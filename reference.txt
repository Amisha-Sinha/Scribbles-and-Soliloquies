When you wish to update this site, follow the following steps:

1. In the story tab, just add another card by copy pasting previous card in case there's space in the row.
2. In case there is no space in the row, copy paste the entire row div element (for both, stories and essays, it is a grid of 4 columns). Here, also create the name title picture for the card on https://edit.org/edit# in MY DESIGNS. 

3. Then, copy paste the entire page of 'familiarstrangers.html' and edit out the content and other things WITHOUT CHANGING anything else.

4. Make sure to import the 'story1.js' in your newstory.html page at the end from assests/js/ folder. Edit it with the number of your current story and change ONLY the total number of pages there, nothing else is to be touched. BUT MAKE SURE TO CREATE A NEW storynumber.js file which is copy of story1.js file and add it in the assests/js/ folder and include it as 
<script src="./assets/js/story1.js"></script>

5. Put the word doc of the story or essay in the folder- "CONTENT FOR THE WEBSITE" in "JUST ME AND MY STUFF" folder and put out watermarks(Grey 35%, Name- AMISHA SINHA, font- Times New Roman) and convert to pdf. Put it on the drive folder- "CONTENT FOR THE WEBSITE" and make it accessible to all, and put its link on the download icon <a> tag.


6. Now, this link that you will get will be in this format-
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vJ6a6mF0TiU-a4I6BA3rUu_jNv9H1ijj/view?usp=drive_link

However, to make it auto download, 
remember that the portion after d/ till /view is the file ID.
Here, File ID is 1vJ6a6mF0TiU-a4I6BA3rUu_jNv9H1ijj

Remove all the characters after fileID, i.e. remove /view?usp=drive_link
Also, after google.com/ remove file/d/

After changing these, type after google.com/uc?export=download&id=

Hence, final auto-download link would look like-

https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1vJ6a6mF0TiU-a4I6BA3rUu_jNv9H1ijj

7. Put this auto download link in the <a> tag.


THAT IS ALL.
