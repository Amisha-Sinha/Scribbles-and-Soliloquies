              <p>India.</p>
              <p>To me, India isn’t just a country of a billion people, it is a country of a billion minds in the process of forging a billion ideas.</p>
              <p>It isn’t just a land where science meets spirituality, India is also well regarded as the cradle of the most developed civilizations in the ancient world.</p>
              <p>The birthplace of several religions, the confluence of arts and culture, India is a land of manifold diversity.</p>
              <p>While the country has a history older than time, the demography of India highlights the youth as the major driving force; ours is a specifically ‘young’ country in terms of the percentage of the youth compared to global superpowers like Britain or the USA.</p>
              <p>Hence, it essentially follows that the youth of the country are an indispensable part of the think-tank that governs every arena of the country. The voice, support, and aspirations of the youth of this country can bring about crucial yet irrevocable changes to the ‘political sphere’ or what I will hereby refer to as the  ‘poli-sphere’ of the nation.</p>
              <p>Throughout the decades of the British invasion, India was subject to not just an economical decline but also witnessed a cultural decadence. While the former was measurable- the share of the Indian economy in world trade had been 17% before the British which was reduced to a paltry 3% after they left- the latter couldn’t be measured in any metric notations.</p>
              <p>Hence, as it goes, I grew up believing in one version of my country- the economic decline version- but as I grew older, I became capable of understanding the nature of the decadence which has become the reality of our land.</p>
              <p>But irrespective of this, I do not deny that when asked to envision the country- its present and future- from the point of view of a young girl in her twenties, I do have some aspirations in my mind.</p>
              <p>The India of my aspirations is one where there is a true understanding of the power bestowed upon us by virtue of fundamental rights. While we do enjoy the freedom of speech and expression, it is grossly misused in today’s time to exercise selective outrage and meet personal agendas. This power that we enjoy should also be executed judiciously to allow the formation of efficient governments to run the country.</p> 
            </div>

            <div class="story-page" id="page2">
              <p>Hence, the aspiration of a free and fair election in every sense of the words ‘free’ and ‘fair’ still continue to headline the hopes of youth, which in a way is a sad thing because, in spite of the seventy-five years of independence and democracy the country has lived through, we still fall short on meeting this fundamental characteristic.</p>
              <p>I also hope for a better acceptance of the country’s heritage and history among its people. We, unfortunately, happen to be a country where true reflections of our history could incite riots and communal violence. Attempts to educate the citizens about the roots and the origins of our country will only be possible if there is a willingness to acknowledge the flaws and address the travesty that has been shoved in our faces in the name of history by ‘educated intellectuals’.</p>
              <p>A greater unity, solidarity among the youth to address the double standards practiced in the name of academia is one of the most alarming needs of the current times for it is rightly said that spreading false information isn’t as dangerous as concealing the right information is.</p>
              <p>A greater focus on addressing the loopholes in the education sector is also required. While concerted efforts have been made to accomplish them in recent times with the implementation of the New Education Policy, I believe that there are still multiple grounds to cover before we call the process a success.</p>
              <p>Majorly, the need to make education accessible and equitable is crucial. Instead of aiming to create an ‘equal’ society, I believe that envisaging a society that practices equity is more appropriate. And this shouldn’t just apply to education, it should extend to the economy as well. Cultivating a society where opportunities for work and education are equitable to its citizens should remain the fundamental focus of the government.</p>
              <p>I also look forward to India being regarded as a land where entrepreneurship is given a boost. We should endeavour to become a country that doesn’t just consist of position-fillers, but position-creators.</p>
              <p>But if there is one thing I aspire for the most, it is an improvement in the ‘poli-sphere’. A government that lives up to democratic principles is extremely important for the country’s development.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-page" id="page3">
              <p>While people belonging to several different religions reside here, it is excruciatingly crucial that we practice religious accommodation, not appeasement. I, personally, believe that notions driven by appeasement in a country’s ‘poli-sphere’ are like termites; they nibble the entire system and pulverize it to dust.</p>
              <p>As a part of the youth of this country, I do believe that my aspirations would strike a relatable chord with most people who endorse synonymous views. </p>
              <p>As a young individual, I have been an active witness to the current state of affairs, both political as well as global, and I do hope that India regains its lost prestige on a global level through the rejuvenation of its rich heritage, culture, and raising the standards of education and economy sanctions.</p>
              <p>Consistent efforts on part of both, the government and its people, would empower India to emerge as a formidable force, leading towards a steadfast rise to the pedestals of holistic development.</p>
